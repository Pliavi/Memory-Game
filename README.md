# Memory Game
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a fast and simple project i'm creating to test react hooks and getting rid of components classes in order to use functional components with hooks.

## Running
To run, just type `yarn start` or `npm run start`, it will open your browser with the running project in development mode at http://localhost:3000
